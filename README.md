# OS-Assignment CPU scheduling algorithms for Shortest job first (SJF) and Round Robin (RR)
This project contain java implementation of two CPU scheduling algorithms Shortest job first (SJF) and Round Robin (RR)

##SJF Algorithm
The SJF Algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The implementation of SJF Algorithm can be found in the <a href ="https://github.com/tasneem1412/OS-Assignment/blob/main/SJF%20OS/src/com/company/Main.java">SJF.JAVA</a>
